# Cryptocurrencies

# Overview of Analysis

I and Martha have done our research. We understood what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. It’s time to put all these skills to use by creating an analysis for our client Accountability Accounting who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked me to create a report that includes the cryptocurrencies currently on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the new investment.

The data Martha and I will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, it is decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrency

# Results:

PCA is a statistical technique to speed up machine learning algorithms when the number of input features (or dimensions) is too high. PCA reduces the number of dimensions by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that contains most of the information in the original large set.

## Deliverable 1: Process the Data for PCA
